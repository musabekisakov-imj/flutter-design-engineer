# Flutter Visual QA

Rendered output is the evidence. Source inspection alone cannot establish visual quality.

## Build a Matrix

Select the smallest representative matrix covering:

- compact and expanded constraints;
- light and dark themes when supported;
- primary, loading, empty, error, and destructive states as applicable;
- default and enlarged text;
- LTR and RTL for localized products.

Record the exact viewport, device-pixel ratio, theme, locale, and fixture state. Read `references/visual-qa.md`.

## Inspect

Review hierarchy and scan path first, then layout, type, spacing rhythm, color roles, controls, content realism, edge behavior, and pixel-level defects. Compare related states side by side. Distinguish implementation defects from subjective preference.

Prioritize:

1. task-blocking clipping, overlap, invisibility, or unreachable controls;
2. broken hierarchy, contrast, state communication, or adaptive composition;
3. inconsistency and polish defects;
4. optional aesthetic refinements.

## Golden Tests

Use golden tests for stable components and deterministic fixtures. Control fonts, animations, time, network content, and pixel ratio. Do not approve broad golden updates without inspecting diffs.

## Close the Loop

Require at least one refinement pass for material findings and recapture affected states. Report the matrix inspected, fixes made, unverified combinations, and artifact paths.
